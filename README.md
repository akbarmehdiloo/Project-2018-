                Background information of Fisher's Iris data set
The Iris flower data set is a specific set of information compiled by Ronald Fisher, a biologist, in the 1930s. It describes particular biological characteristics of various types of Iris flowers, specifically, the length and width of both pedals and the sepals, which are part of the flowerâ€™s reproductive system.
The Iris flower data set is now widely used as a data set for testing purposes in computer science.
