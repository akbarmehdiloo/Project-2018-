#Fisher's Iris data set

The Iris flower data set is widely used as a data set for testing purposes in computer science and data science.
The data set was compiled by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in 1936. It describes particular biological characteristics of various types of Iris flowers, specifically, the length and width of both pedals and the sepals, which are part of the flowerâ€™s reproductive system.

This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature. Fisher's paper is a classic in the field and is referenced frequently to this day.  The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other.
